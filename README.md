## ðŸ““ Data Analysis Notebooks

These Jupyter notebooks contain the code and analysis behind two data science projects completed during NYU's Introduction to Data Science course.

### ðŸ§ª Hypothesis Testing on Movie Ratings (`DA1.ipynb`)
Performs statistical tests (Welch's t-test, ANOVA) to explore the impact of factors like popularity, release year, and gender on movie ratings. The notebook includes Python implementations using `scipy.stats` and concludes with evidence of significant rating differences across groups.

### ðŸ“‹ Survey Analysis of Human Behavior (`DA2.ipynb`)
Uses regression modeling to investigate how personality traits and social preferences influence movie rating predictability. Applies both simple and multiple regression approaches, and evaluates prediction strength using Coefficient of Determination (COD) metrics.
